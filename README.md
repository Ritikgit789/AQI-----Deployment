# AQI-----Deployment

Air quality Index prediction using Machine learning


Project Overview
This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) for a given location using environmental features like pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3) and weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed). AQI is a numerical scale indicating air pollution levels, with higher values signaling worse air quality. The project employs K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor and Random Forest (RF) Regressor models for prediction, and a Flask backend serves the model via a web interface for real-time AQI predictions.
The project follows a standard ML workflow: data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. This README outlines the step-by-step implementation, including code snippets for key components.

Project Workflow
Step 1: Problem Definition and Objective
Objective: Predict continuous AQI values using regression models based on pollutant and meteorological features.
Why KNN and RF Regressors?
KNN Regressor: Simple, instance-based model that predicts AQI by averaging the AQI of k-nearest neighbors. Effective for local patterns but sensitive to feature scaling.
RF Regressor: Ensemble of decision trees, robust to outliers and non-linear relationships, ideal for complex environmental data.
Deployment: A Flask web app allows users to input features and receive AQI predictions.


Step 2: Data Collection
Dataset: Use open-source air quality datasets from platforms like OpenAQ, EPA, or Kaggle (e.g., “Air Quality Data in India”).
Features:
Pollutants: PM2.5 (µg/m³), PM10 (µg/m³), NO2 (ppb), SO2 (ppb), CO (ppm), O3 (ppb).
Weather: Temperature (°C), Humidity (%), Wind Speed (m/s), Pressure (hPa).
Target: AQI (continuous, 0–500).


Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Tasks:
Handle missing values (e.g., impute with mean/median or drop rows).
Remove outliers using z-scores or IQR.
Scale features (crucial for KNN) using StandardScaler.
Encode categorical variables (if any, e.g., location).


Step 4: Model Training
Models:
KNN Regressor: Tune n_neighbors (e.g., 3–10) and weights (uniform or distance).
RF Regressor: Tune n_estimators (e.g., 100–500), max_depth, and min_samples_split.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV for optimal parameters.
